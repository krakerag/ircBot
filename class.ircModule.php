/**
 * ircModule class
 * This is a base class which all modules extend from
 * It sets up the framework for a module to have a batch of commands and those commands triggering
 * a batch of functions which are related to those commands, parsing the message as it
 * gets passed over, and causing reaction.
 *
 * Initialising an ircModule should receive a copy of the ircBot so communications can be
 * performed on the socket present.
